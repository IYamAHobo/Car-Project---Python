FILE = FILEPATH

The MAIN function:
  
  
  isInProgram = A variable that keeps the program running, even after exception handling of possible errors.
    Start program with variable being "TRUE"
  isPlacingOrder = A variable that if the user needs to place an order or not.
    Start program with variable being "FALSE"
  
  # WHILE LOOP FOR THE MENU AND USER INPUT.
  While the isInPRogram variable is true:
      Display a "Welcome" message to begin the program.
    Try to:
      Open file in read mode.
      Display information in the file.
    Error exception: #An error will occur if there is no file already.
      If no file exists, circumvent the read file error by creating a file.

    # Show a menu for users to interact with:
    Display a message asking for user's to make a selection from the menu
    Display option 1, to create a car order
    Display option 2, to see the order
    Display option 3, exit program

    Try to:
      Turn user input into an integer.
    Error exception:
      If error is created, ask user to reinput their selection as a number that corresponds with one of the options.
      # Will bounce to beginning of the while loop.

    # Now start the car selection process
    IF user selection is 1, then:
      The varaible "isPlacingOrder" value is now "TRUE"
    WHILE the variable "isPlacingOrder" is "TRUE":
      # Continue creating pseudocode here.
    
    If user selection is 2, then:
      # Continue creating pseudocode here.

    IF user selection is 3, then:
      Exit the program.
  
    IF user selection is none of the above, then:
      Dispaly a message notifying user of invalid input. Should start while loop over and redirect user to the main menu.
